Test of the LTDC part on the Arduino Giga with a passive VGA adapter
(SMT32H747 part with 8M SDRAM 16 bits, plus USN hos for keyboard input)

As the Giga Display is not very usefull (as a 480x800 display rotated 90Â°),
I started experiment on an external VGA display 

Some pictures in Wiki part

v0: 
- proof of concept is ok: 8 colors display at 800x600 with some resistors and cables
- RGB565 mode and L8 mode tested (L8 used in the 9816 emulator)

next:
- creating an add-on board (see wiki), similar to raspberrypi vga 666
