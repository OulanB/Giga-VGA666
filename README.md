First try to use the LTDC part on the Arduino Giga with a passive VGA adapter

As the Giga Display is not very usefull (as a 480x800 display rotated 90Â°),
I started experiment on an external VGA display 

Some pictures in Wiki part

v0 : - proof of concept is good 8 colors display at 800x600
     - in RGB565 mode, ok also in L8 mode (used in the 9816 emulator)
     - creating an add-on board (see wiki), similar to raspberrypi vga 666
