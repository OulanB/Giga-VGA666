First draft for add-on board 

- one with only VGA

- one with VGA + 2 PS/2 DIN6 

Done with EasyEDA Pro, BUT

NOT TESTED AT ALL ... you are on your own 

Feel free to make comments, those are my firsts designs !!
and are certainly full of mistakes.

hmmm PS/2 is TTL 5V, IO is 3.3V ?? perhaps some level converter needed ? added a tension divisor and a GND plane below
